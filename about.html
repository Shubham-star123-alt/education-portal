  <h1>About Us</h1>

  <p>
    This website was developed by <strong>Shubham Shatrughna Panchal</strong> 
    as part of an educational and social initiative aimed at improving 
    awareness about government schemes, educational resources, and 
    support systems available for schools and students.
  </p>

  <p>
    The core idea behind this project came from our group:
    <strong>Himesh Bhosale, Pranav Panchal, Aditya Prakash Yadav, and Sahil Bhosale.</strong> 
    Together, we visited several government schools in and around our region 
    to understand real-world challenges faced by students, teachers, and 
    school administrations.
  </p>

  <p>
    During our visits, we observed that many schools struggle with proper 
    communication with government departments, awareness of schemes, 
    access to funding opportunities, and information about student support 
    programs. Many beneficial schemes exist, but the lack of centralized 
    information often prevents schools and students from taking advantage 
    of them.
  </p>

  <p>
    This website aims to bridge that gap by bringing together government 
    schemes, scholarship opportunities, educational resources, complaint 
    portals, and institutional support information in one accessible place. 
    Our goal is to make this information easier to understand and available 
    to everyone — especially students from government schools who may not 
    always have easy access to such resources.
  </p>

  <p>
    We hope this platform contributes to awareness, transparency, and better 
    educational opportunities for students while supporting schools in 
    connecting more effectively with government initiatives.
